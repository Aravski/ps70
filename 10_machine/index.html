<h4> 
We started off chipping off the supports off the 3d printed green parts for our drawing machine. This task was much more difficult than we expected, but at the same time it was satisfying. We learned that the tweezers were too soft and flimsy to break off the supports, so we then resorted to the standard plastic cutters, however because there were only 2 cutters, we had to take turns using them for the most difficult and intricate parts. We learned that for some of the supports different tools were required such as pokers for the small bolt/screw hole areas.


Soon enough all the supports had come off, and we were now figuring out what to do with these parts. At the same time we were unsure about what to actually make for this assignment, we wanted to make a unique product that could have some functionality if it were to be improved upon, therefore we decided to make our drawing machine be able to draw with more than 1 color. We had no idea where to start so we spent a good chunk of our time finding images/tutorials to help us start to assemble the drawing machine. This task proved difficult since we found no video tutorials on how to assemble the parts we had, therefore we resorted to looking at images to figure out what to do, kinda like building legos but with many many steps in one and with a very bad view angle. Some difficult moments in this task were to figure out which parts go where and how they functioned, so with some imagination we figured out how the gears were supposed to move the belt and how the parts were supposed to hold up without breaking. Of course our troubles cannot come to an end- a part of making prototypes- so we ran into the problem of certain parts not being able to fit with our configurations. An example of this includes the gear that holds onto the motor driveshaft being too big, so we had to have new parts printed.



After a tough assembly, (not complete since there were a few parts that weren't printed yet) we still had some belt issues, sometimes the belt was skipping steps, we also had not latched it on yet. After addressing those issues we had a complete build, now came time for the code and wiring. 






On the night before the due date, we tried to code the machine. It started off pretty well, and we got it to sketch around through a website quite easily (thanks to Judy). After getting that to work, we started on the homing. While working on the homing, the timing belt was too loose. We worked to fix this, and then the X axis homing code was pretty close to working. We then realised that the carriage did not hit the limit switch, which we couldnâ€™t fix until going to the lab.
