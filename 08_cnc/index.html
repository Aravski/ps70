<h3>Week 8: CNC Milling</h3>
</div>

<h4>Assignment: MADE Something With CNC</h4>

<h4>I made a car body for my electric car, I used wood blocks shaped like a car which were all held by tape, then I vacuum(idk how to spell that)-formed that to form the body. Some challenges were making a body that would fit my car (slightly larger) but would also fit the vacuum machine, so actually figuring out the size aspect took a while. Another small challenge was actually cutting out unecessary parts of the plastic with a small razor blade, this was just meticulous and I noticed that one side of the design was thicker than the other (the plastic was thicker) so cutting out the plastic on that side took a while, whereas for the other side it did not take that much effort. Something that I learned was how to use the software for the big CNC machine, I also learned that when vacuum forming, as soon as the "bubble" forms turn on the vacuum then RIGHT AFTER push down, do not wait. I also learned that cutting out the unecessary parts of plastic will be hard, and it will look wonky, so be prepared and take things slowly, also in the end file down the plastic to have a smoother finish. </h4>
