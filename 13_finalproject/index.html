<h4>I decided to make a car as my final project. I used 2 ESP32 Xiao boards which communicated using the espnow library, this meant that the two boards could communicate wirelessly. This part took hours since downgrading the version was necessary since sometimes the servo motor wouldnt function but the other DC motors would. I spent 20+ hours of cad trying to design a lamborghini (there is a picture of just the front) but after it was done it turns out that it was saved on my desktop so I couldn't get the chance to print it out. Therefore I decided to improvise. I used a joystick to control the movements of both the servo and the motors, using the x and y axis' respectively. I then used an acrylic board for the components to rest on. The LED strip was my favorite part since seeing that strong read glow at 12 in the morning was a feeling I won't forget. I also was confused as to why my arduino boards wouldn't connect and spent 3 hours on that, I tried everything, I even tried hacking my own computer using sudo code. In the end Bobby helped me figure it out in 2 minutes, it was a shorted circuit causing the Mac to think that there was a power overload through the USB. Overall I will continue to fabricate (make) more things, ill update this soon with the link to my new website! Thank you so much for this wonderful summer!
